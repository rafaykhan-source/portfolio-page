        I developed marshmallow, an automation project for Princeton University’s
        <a href="https://access.princeton.edu/">Emma Bloomberg Center</a> (EBC). It has helped connect ~600 Students (3
        Semesters) with their mentors, faculty, and college advisers. This reduced
        what was initially a several day task to half a minute.

        I pride myself in my ability to learn languages & frameworks quickly, and
        am excited to contribute to life-changing software and work on a team as a
        software engineer!
